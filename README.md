Website Description:

The Mojave Refinery positions the player in the role of an industrial worker assigned to the front end of an expansive and intense processing system. The simulation takes place in a single working day.
The player begins with a clear work order describing production targets, time constraints, and material priorities. The work of the player is straightforward and physical: to disassemble decommissioned aircraft, extract components that can be reused and gather materials that will be subsequently used to create housing for the unhoused.
The entirety of the refinery is not displayed to the player. The larger system logistics, housing assembly, distribution, is out of sight. This narrow focus is deliberate. The Mojave Refinery is experienced from the inside, at the scale where large systems are reduced to repetitive actions and tasks with intentionally constrained decisions. 
As the workday progresses, the pressure builds up. Aircraft continue to arrive and the housing demand remains unresolved. The voices of the unhoused is not conversation or exposition of a narrative, but a residue, remanence, in the form of comments, complaints, learning artifacts left in the workplace.
The game does not require the player to resolve the system. It challenges them to operate within it. It forces the player to work, to process, and to experience the stress of the efficiency of industrialism and the urgency of basic human needs. 


Composite Drawing Logic | The Architecture of Conversion: 

The composite image collapses all eight operational zones of the Mojave Refinery's disassembly process into a single infrastructural organism. 
It visualizes the transformation of an idle aircraft into raw material for housing by tracing the hidden systems that connect extraction, 
logistics, and reconstruction. The darker elements highlight the conversion corridor, where aircraft parts are fed into containerized housing modules. 
Layered transparencies and intersecting geometries are intentional for it reveals the complexity and urgency of this industrial choreography, where precision and disorder coexist 
within one continuous spatial field.
